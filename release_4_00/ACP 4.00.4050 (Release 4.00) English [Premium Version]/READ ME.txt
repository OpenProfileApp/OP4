Thank you for downloading the world's most advanced character profile template!
This is version 4.00 and is the first release after near 5 years in development.

To properly use this document you will require Adobe Acrobat Reader (latest).
If you experience issues you will NOT recieve support unless you are using the
latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. You may need to install the provided
font (Open Sans) for the document to work properly.

Most pages here are duplicable if you have the project file (seperate)! If you
perhaps have a character with 10 powers but only have 2 power pages, then simply
duplicate the pages till you reach the desired amount using the project file in
Apache OpenOffice. Once in the project file you can also freely change font,
color, text boxes, and so much more basically creating your own theme!

If you want to replace the default character, Alice (drawn by Georgia Chalinger)
or the OpenSourceACP's logo, then you will either need either purchase Adobe
Acrobat Reader Pro OR open the project file (seperate) via Apache OpenOffice and
replace the image(s). Once replaced simply export to .pdf and you're ready!
